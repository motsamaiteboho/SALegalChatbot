JUDGMENT
______________________________________________________________
WILLIS J:
[1] The applicant has approached the court by way of motion proceed-
ings for an order that the first and second respondents are jointly and
severally liable, the one paying the other to be absolved, to pay the ap-
plicant an amount of some R15 million, together with interests and
costs.
[2] The debt arises from a written agreement of loan concluded
between the applicant and the first respondent secured by a written
deed of suretyship signed by the second respondent. The third re-
spondent is a nominal respondent only. The money was lent as so-
called “short term bridging finance” in a property development
scheme. In the papers this type of funding is called “mezzanine fund-
ing”. The expression “mezzanine funding” has come to the fore in the
South Gauteng High Court relatively recently. Although there may be
3
minor but nevertheless distinct differences between “short term
bridging finance” and “mezzanine funding”, for the purposes of this
judgment these differences are unimportant.
[3] After several postponements at the request of the first and second
respondents, the application came before Barrie AJ on 15 February,
2011. No affidavits were filed ion behalf of the respondents. It would
seem that Barrie AJ was troubled about the lawfulness of the rate of
interest which the applicant had claimed. Barrie AJ suggested that an
amicus curiae should be appointed to make submissions to the court
on the issue. Mr Moorcroft was duly appointed as amicus. He has the
distinction of being the author of Banking Law and Practice.1 I am
much indebted to Mr Moorcroft for his helpful submissions in the mat-
ter as I am to the Johannesburg Bar Council, which acting in accord-
ance with the finest of its traditions, adopted a wise and obliging atti-
tude in selecting his appointment.
[4] The borrower in a “mezzanine funding” transaction is typically a
small developer requiring capital for which its own funding is insuffi-
cient and for which the commercial banks are unwilling to lend. The
lender borrows the money from the commercial banks. The money is
lent short-term. The risks but the rewards too are high for the lender.
Borrowers of “mezzanine funding” are typically experienced “players”
in the property development market.

[5] The rate of interest charged to the first respondent was 1,25% per
weekmonth until the first respondent fell into arrears and thereafter
1,5% per weekmonth. In an affidavit by Mr Duncan Campbell, the
portfolio manager of the applicant, the change in interest rate after a
debtor is in default isn justified on two main grounds: (i) administrat-
ive costs in the monitoring and “follow-up” of the debt increase sub-
stantially once it is in default and (ii) the risk rises considerably.
[6] The first respondent fell into arrears on 12th October 2008. The ap-
plicant elected to cancel the agreement on 22nd May, 2009. The
amicus and the counsel for the applicant agreed that the amount ow-
ing as at 6th March 2009 was R 11 337 822, 54.
[7] The amicus and counsel for the applicant agreed that the in du-
plum rule should be been applied to the calculations made. The man-
ner of application of the in duplum rule in this case is consistent with
the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal (‘the SCA”) in the
case of Nedbank Ltd and Others v The National Credit Regulator and
Another.2
[8] Mindful of the fact the National Credit Act, No.34 of 2005, as
amended (“the NCA”) has repealed the Usury Act, No. 73 of 1968, as
2 [20011] ZASCA 35 (28 March 2011)
5
amended, the amicus and counsel for the applicant agreed that there
are three issues that fall to be decided:
(i) whether the applicant’s calculations result in a con-
travention of the NCA;
(ii) whether the loan is usurious to the extent that it is
unlawful or contra bonos mores;
(iii) whether the increase in the rate from 1,25% to
1,5% after the first respondent was in default consti-
tutes an unlawful penalty in terms of the Conventional
Penalties Act, No.51 of 1962, as amended.
[9] Referring to sections 1, 4(1) (b), 4 (2) (c), 7 (1) (b) and 9(4) of the
NCA, the amicus and counsel for the applicant agreed that the provi-
sions of the NCA were not applicable to this transaction because the
principal debtor is a juristic person whose asset value or annual
turnover at the signature date of the agreement exceeded R1 million
and the agreement constituted a “large agreement” as envisaged in the
NCA with its value exceeding the thresholds determined in terms of
the NCA. I agree.
[10] The amicus and counsel for the applicant both submitted that in-
sofar as the second respondent as surety was concerned, my sister
Satchwell was correct in holding in Firstrand Bank Ltd v Carl Beck
Estates (Pty) Ltd3 that sureties for agreements that fall outside of the
3 2009 (3) SA 384 (T)
6
NCA cannot invoke the provisions of the NCA as a defence. See, also:
Standard Bank of SA Ltd v Hunkydory Investments (Pty) Ltd and An-
other.4 As I said in Stocker v Giddings and Another, 5 a unanimous “full
bench” appeal, it is trite that sureties are promissores subsidiarii, that
their obligations are accessory to that of the principal debtor.6 In that
judgment I observed that this entails, inter alia, that a surety has the
same defences in rem as the principal debtor. I repeat my summary
that, in plain English, the Latin expressions in this paragraph mean
that sureties have the same substantive defences as are available to
the principal debtor, no more and no less. Accordingly, I agree with
Satchwell J. The applicant succeeds on the first point to be decided.
[11] In determining whether a defence of extortionate rates of interest
or usury can be sustained it is helpful to refer to the judgment of
Innes J (as he then was) in Reuter v Yates7 where he said:
It comes to this - in deciding whether the defence of usury
has been sustained, and whether the lender has taken such
an undue advantage of the borrower, has so practised extor-
tion and oppression, that his conduct, being akin to fraud,
disentitles him to relief, the Court will examine all the cir-
cumstances of the case. It will not only look at the scale of
4 (1) 2010 (1) SA 627 (C) at paragraphs [13] and [14]
5 GSJ Case No A3006/2010 delivered on 17 November, 2010 at paragraph [7].
Boruchowitz, Monama JJ and I dismissed an appeal from the judgment of Van
Eeden AJ.

and Co 1912 AD 747 at 750 and Trust Bank of Africa Ltd v Frysch 1977 (3) SA 562

interest which has been stipulated for, but will have regard
to the ordinary rate prevalent in similar transactions, to the
security offered and the risk run, to the length of time for
which the loan was given, the amount lent, and the relative
positions of the parties. Approaching the present dispute in
that way, we find that the evidence given by the appellant
was not very full. It certainly does not prove the existence of
extortion or oppression. The rate agreed upon was high, but
the parties were dealing at arms’ length, the sum advanced
was a small one for a short period, and there appears to
have been no security.
Innes J found that the borrower was not justified in refusing to pay on
the ground that a usurious rate of interest had been “stipulated for”.8
The court, sitting in an appeal from the magistrate’s court in Johan-
nesburg, affirmed the principles set out by Watermeyer J (as he then
was) in Dyason v Ruthven.9 In Bekker and Another v Oos-Vrystaat
Kaap Koöperasie Bpk10 the Supreme Court of Appeal confirmed that
Reuter v Yates was correct in terms of the onus which a person claim-
ing an unlawfully high rate of interest bears. With exquisite polite-
ness, the amicus and counsel for the applicant requested me to deliver
a “reportable” judgment because “those in the market” needed to
know whether this was still good law in this division.

[12] Quite apart from any other consideration, this decision remains
most emphatically good law in this division: it was decided by a full
court having an area of jurisdiction coextensive with that of the
present day North and South Gauteng High Courts. The principles in
question cannot have been abrogated by disuse. I consider the case
Reuter v Yates to be another of the little treasures in our legal attic.11
That which Innes J said in the passage quoted above remains good
law. Both the amicus and counsel for the applicant agreed that this
was so. I am fortified in my conviction on this point by the fact that, in
the shadow of Table Mountain, Yekiso J referred to the case with ap-
proval in Structured Mezzanine Investments (Pty) Ltd v Davids and Oth-
ers.12
[13] For the sake of completeness I record that, on the clear authority
of the cases of Sasfin v Beukes13 and Juglal NO v Shoprite Checkers
(Pty) Ltd t/a OK Franchise Division,14 it cannot be found that the agree-
ment was contra bonos mores: the first and second respondents were
“no babes in the woods” and, accordingly, there are no considerations
of protecting the poor or others in an inferior bargaining position such
that it would be unconscionable or immoral to enforce the agreements

in question.15 Against the background of the facts in casu, the second
point must also be decided in favour of the applicant.
[14] On the question of whether the increase in the rate of interest
from 1,25 to 1,5% after the first respondent was in default amounted
to a penalty in contravention of the Conventional Penalties Act, the
splendid unanimity of the amicus and counsel for the applicant fell
apart. They did, however agree that, on this issue too, it would be im-
portant to have a “reportable” judgment. Relying on the provisions of
section 1 of the Conventional Penalties Act, the amicus submitted that
this was a penalty.
[15] This section provides as follows:
(1) A stipulation, hereinafter referred to as a penalty stipulation,
whereby it is provided that any person shall, in respect of an
actor omission in conflict with a contractual obligation, be liable
to pay a sum of money or to deliver or perform anything for the
benefit of any other person, hereinafter referred to as a creditor,
either by way of a penalty or as liquidated damages, shall, sub-
ject to the provisions of this Act, be capable of being enforced in
any competent court.
15 Since time immemorial, our common law has set its face against exploitation in
the levying of interest. A most illuminating discussion on this aspect can be found in
an historical survey by Grové, Die gemeenregtelike beheer van woeker in die Suis-
Afrikaanse Reg, De Jure, 1989 (22), 233 and Die gemeenregtelike beheer van woeker
in die Suis-Afrikaanse Reg (vervolg), De Jure, 1990 (23),118.
10
(2) Any sum of money for the payment of which or anything for the
delivery or performance of which a person may so become liable,
is in the Act referred to as a penalty.
On this issue, we authors on matters of banking part company
amicably.16 Section 1 of the Conventional Penalties Act does not so
much define a penalty as that it provides that what is conventionally
regarded as a penalty falls within the purview of the Act. In other
words, one must first ask oneself whether the increase in the rate of
interest is a penalty. In my view, it is not.
[16] As a former banker myself, I think I may fairly take cognisance of
the fact that, as counsel for the applicant submitted, the commercial
banks have, since time immemorial, charged a higher rate of interest
once a debtor is in default for precisely the same reasons as those
advanced by Mr Campbell. As Innes J said in the passage above in
Reuter v Yates, risk is a factor to relevant interest. Self-evidently, risk
increases once a debtor is in default. Besides, these justifications by
Mr Campbell for the increase in the rate of interest were undisputed.
[17] Even if I am wrong in regard to whether the increase in the rate of
interest amounts to a penalty, the amicus and counsel for the applic-
ant both agreed, entirely correctly, that the Conventional Penalties Act
only affects the enforceability of a penalty if it is out of proportion to
the prejudice suffered, if it is markedly greater than the prejudice and
16 The amicus and I share a similar pastime: writing books on banking. Mine was

11
if the excess is such that it would be unfair to enforce the penalty.17
They also agreed that the onus of proof is on the debtor to show that
the penalty is out of proportion to the prejudice suffered.18 Mindful of
the recent judgments decided by Yekiso J in Structured Mezzanine In-
vestments (Pty) Ltd v Davids and Others, referred to above and Bozalek
J in Plumbago Financial Services (Pty) Ltd t/a Toshiba Rentals v Janap
Joseph t/a Project Finance,19 the interest claimed does not appear to
be disproportionate to the prejudice which the applicant has suffered.
The applicant succeeds on the third point as well.
[18] At the time when I reserved judgment there was a not unimport-
ant point which we all overlooked. It is that the applicant is not en-
titled to interest at the rate provided for in the agreement after that
agreement had been cancelled. The reason lies in the doctrine of elec-
tion as set out by Watermeyer AJ (as he then was) in the case of Segal
v Mazzur.20 An innocent party to a contract that has been breached by
another party cannot blow hot and cold; he cannot approbate and rep-
robate the contract.21 Segal v Mazzur was expressly approved by the
SCA in S Du Plessis and Another NNO v Rolfes Ltd.22 The point is so

clear that I have not invited counsel to come to court again to address
me on it. The applicant cancelled the agreement on 22nd May, 2009.
Interest for the period from 6th March, 2009 to 22nd May, 2009
amounts to R1 870 737. This is the period from the date upon which
we all agreed the amount owing was R11 337 822 until the date of
cancellation. The sum of R11 337 822 and R1 870 737 is R13 208
559. The applicant is entitled to payment of this sum.
[19] Mindful of sections 1 (1) and (2) of the Prescribed Rate of Interest
Act, No. 55 of 1975, the new section 2A introduced by the Prescribed
Rate of Interest Amendment Act, No. 7 of 1997and the helpful judg-
ment by Thring J on the subject in the MV Sea Joy case,23 it seems to
me appropriate to order interest at the prescribed rate in terms of the
Prescribed Rate of Interest Act, as amended, from 23rd May, 2009, the
day after cancellation to the date of payment. The prescribed rate is
15,5% per annum.24 The agreement between the applicant and the first
respondent provides for costs on an attorney and client scale.
[20] The following is the order of the court:
The first and second respondents are ordered, jointly and sever-
ally, the one paying the other to be absolved, to make payment to
the applicant of:
1. R13 208 559 (thirteen million, two hundred and eight
thousand, five hundred and fifty-nine rands);

2. Interest on the aforesaid sum at the rate of 15,5% per an-
num, calculated from 23rd May, 2009 to date of payment; and
3. The costs of the application, which costs may include the
costs consequent upon the employment of two counsel and
may be taxed on an attorney and client scale.
